How To
======

The work process is divided into **three** phases which will be described in the following sections:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   htspectra
   httrain
   htpred

.. - Acquisition of spectral training data
.. - Generation of trained neural network model
.. - Real-time prediction

For each of these steps a seperate python file can be found in the directory :file:`repo/scripts/`.

Global and project specific variables (**paths**, **prediction classes** etc.) need to configured within 
:file:`repo/scripts/config.ini` before running the scripts.
