Application Use
===============

**SRSMP** prediction application script is implemented to be used in conjungtion with 
*SpatialAnalyzer*. The communication between the two applications is implemented using 
the **datashare** file format. This *How To* shows the step-by-step instructions on how 
to setup and use the framework. For a more in depth look at the implementation, please 
consult **LINK**.

The result is that with a button press on the *T-Probe*, the coordinates of the tip of the 
spectral probe and the material prediction are determined.
