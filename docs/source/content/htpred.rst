Application Use
===============

**SRSMP** prediction application script is implemented to be used in conjungtion with 
*SpatialAnalyzer*. The communication between the two applications is implemented using 
the **datashare** file format. This *How To* shows the step-by-step instructions on how 
to setup and use the framework. For a more in depth look at the implementation, please 
consult **LINK**.

Following this *How To*, the user will be able to get a material property prediciton 
coupled with the corresponding 3D corrdinates within SPatialAnalyzer.

Set-Up SpatialAnalyzer
----------------------
To attain the desired behaviour, we use *measurement plans (MP)* and *MP execution 
nodes*. The appropiate *MP* can be found in :file:`REPO/spatialanalyzer_mp/thor_predictor.mp`.

Before adding the *MP*, make sure that the *Leica AT 960* is connected and the interface 
is running.

Open the *MP editor* by clicking on :menuselection:`Scripts --> Create/Edit 
Measurement Plans`.
