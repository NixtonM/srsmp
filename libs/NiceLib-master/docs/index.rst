NiceLib
=======

NiceLib is a package for rapidly developing "nice" Python bindings to C libraries, using ``cffi``.

It lets you turn a C function like this

.. code-block:: c

    int my_c_function(int arg1, float arg2, uint* out_arr, int out_arr_size, int reserved);

into a Python function that can be called like this ::

    out_arr = my_c_function(arg1, arg2)

just by defining a signature like this ::

    class MyLib(NiceLib):
        ...
        my_c_function = Sig('in', 'in', 'arr', 'len', 'ignore')

while giving you easy error handling and more.


Installing
----------

NiceLib is available on PyPI::

    $ pip install nicelib

If you would like to use the development version, download and extract a zip of the source from our
`GitHub page <https://github.com/mabuchilab/NiceLib>`_ or clone it using git. Now install::

    $ cd /path/to/NiceLib
    $ pip install .

Introduction
------------

NiceLib essentially consists of two layers:

* Tools for directly using C headers to generate an importable Python module
* An interface for quickly and cleanly defining a Pythonic mid-level binding

Mid-level means that functions take *input* arguments, return *output* arguments, and raise
Exceptions on error. NiceLib tries to simplify commonly-seen C idioms, like using user-created
buffers for returning output strings. Take, for example, this toy binding for the NIDAQmx library::

    from nicelib import load_lib, NiceLib, Sig

    class NiceNI(NiceLib):
        _info_ = load_lib('ni')
        _prefix_ = 'DAQmx'

        GetSysDevNames = Sig('buf', 'len')

Now, we can simply call ``NiceNI.GetSysDevName(code)``, which is equivalent to the following::

    lib_info = load_lib('ni')
    ffi, lib = lib_info._ffi, lib_info.lib

    def GetSysDevNames():
        buflen = 512
        buf = ffi.new('char[]', buflen)
        ret = lib.DAQmxGetSysDevNames(buf, buflen)
        return ffi.string(buf), ret

Many of our C library's functions may use status codes as their return value. To automatically check the return code and raise an exception if warranted, we can use ``_ret_``::

    from nicelib import RetHandler

    # Define a new return handler
    @RetHandler(num_retvals=0)
    def daq_errorcheck(ret):
        if ret != 0:
            raise DAQError(ret)

    class NiceNI(NiceLib):
        _ret_ = daq_errorcheck
        [...]

Often a C library will have method-like functions, each of which take a handle as its first argument. These translate naturally into Python objects, obviating you of the need to pass the handle all the time. For example, here's a partial definition of a Task object, again wrapping
NIDAQmx::

    class NiceNI(NiceLib):
        [...]
        CreateTask = Sig('in', 'out')

        class Task(NiceObject):
            _init_ = 'CreateTask'

            StartTask = Sig('in')
            ReadAnalogScalarF64 = Sig('in', 'in', 'out', 'ignore')

For both of these function signatures, the first ``'in'`` argument is the Task handle. We can then use the class to make and use ``Task`` objects::

    task = NiceNI.Task('myTask')
    task.StartTask()

By specifying ``_init_`` when defining ``Task``, the string ``'myTask'`` is passed to ``NiceNI.CreateTask``, whose return value (a task handle) is stored in the ``Task`` instance.


Automatically Processing Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The awesome ``cffi`` package greatly improves wrapping C libraries in Python by allowing you to load header files directly, instead of manually churning out mind-numbing ``ctypes`` boilerplate. However it's not perfect---in particular, it makes a fairly limited attempt at preprocessing header files, meaning that in many cases you'll have to preprocess them yourself, either manually or by running e.g. the gcc preprocessor. NiceLib provides preprocessing facilities that aim to allow you to use unmodified header files to generate a "compiled" ffi module, without requiring a C compiler.

NiceLib's preprocessor has basic support for both object-like and simple function-like macros, which it translates into equivalent [#]_ portable Python source code. For example

.. code-block:: c

    #define CONST_VAL       (1 << 4) | (1 << 1)
    #define LTZ(val)        ((val) < 0)

becomes the Python code::

    CONST_VAL = (1 << 4) | (1 << 1)
    def LTZ(val):
        return (val) < 0

The preprocessor also supports conditionals (``#ifdef`` and friends), ``#include``\s, and
platform-specific predefined macros (like ``__linux__``, ``__WIN64``, and ``__x86_64``).

Currently, ``#pragma once`` is supported, but other ``#pragma`` directives are ignored.




.. [#] Note that, due to the nature of the C preprocessor, this generated code cannot always be
       truly equivalent. However, in the overwhelming majority of cases, the macros defined in
       library header files are quite simple.
